This blog is for informational purposes only, based on initial analysis and security testing of the data stored in the Word Trip app installed and used on an iOS mobile device.

## App Description

Word Trip is a word puzzle game app where you connect letters on a board to find hidden words. As you complete the puzzles, the puzzle games become more challenging. The user can earn points, use power-ups, and can compete with friends to see who can solve puzzles the fastest.
