## Testing Objectives and Analysis Procedures

### Application Details
- **Name**: Wordtrip
- **Version**: 1.446.0 v.2024.11.14 (632295)

### Device Details

The device used for testing this app was an **iPhone 8** (Model MQ6V2LL/A) with **iOS version 16.7.10**. A full file system image of this mobile was acquired for the analysis. To achieve this, we used **Autopsy** to analyze the full system image. Multiple images were taken at different times to check the difference in data stored and app behavior.

### Software Used

Due to the kind and amount of data in the iOS image, we used multiple software for our analysis. A link to all of these tools is mentioned in the reference section of the blog.

| Software                  | Version    | Purpose                          |
|---------------------------|------------|----------------------------------|
| **Autopsy**                | 4.21.0     | Analyzing image                 |
| **DB Browser for SQLite**  | 1.18.6     | Open SQLite database files|
| **iBackupViewer**          | 7.65.0.247 | View iOS device backups    |
| **iLeapp**| v1.5.1    | Analyzing image, Protobuf parsing                  |
| **3uTools**           | 1.9.7      | View iOS device backups               |

## Testing and Analysis

Testing of the app accounted for the fact that all requested permissions, including notification access, were granted. The app was used over a one-month period to allow sufficient time for data collection and domain interactions.

Analysis was conducted in accordance with the objectives specified in the test cases:

### 1. Personal Information
   - **Objective:** Ensure that personal information is collected, stored, and shared properly and securely.
   - **Procedure:** Check what information is collected and if it sent securely (using HTTPS or another secure method); check that the app has a clear privacy policy explaining how personal information is used and shared. Verify that uses can control what personal information they want to share and can turn off data collection.
   - **Expected Outcome:** Personal info is collected only when necessary, securely stored, and users know how their data is used; Users can manage or delete their personal information easily.
   - **Artifacts:**

The x-bplist (binary property list) file contains the public IP address in the device used for this testing. This format is used to store structured data and is commonly employed by macOS and iOS applications to hold configuration settings (such as those for the app Word Trip), cached data, user preferences, and system information.

- **Recommendation:**  Although secure transmission of data is mentioned and security practices are described, there is no explicit mention of HTTPS or TLS protocols for data transmission.
  
### 2. Device Information
   - **Objective:** Ensure device information is collected and used securely. 
   - **Procedure:** Check what device information is collected (i.e. device type, OS, etc.) and ensure that the app asks for permission; Check that device IDs or other identifies are protected or anonymized.
   - **Expected Outcome:** Personal device information is collected only when needed, transmitted securely, and protected; Users can manage or delete their device information when they want.
   - **Artifacts:**

- **Recommendations:**
   - **Device identifiers are protected or anonymized:** The policy mentions data protection practices but does not state whether device IDs are anonymized or hashed before storage or transfer. There is no evidence indicating how this is achieved. 
   - **Secure transmission of device information:** The policy does not explicitly confirm the use of HTTPS or other secure transfer protocols. Evidence indicates that information is sent in clear text. 
  

### 3. Location history and GPS Data
   - **Objective:** Analyze GPS and location history data to determine the movements of the device user during the timeframe of interest. 
   - **Procedure:** Extract and analyze location data from apps (e.g., Google Maps, Apple Maps), system logs, and geotagged media.
   - **Analysis Points:** 
      - Locations visited (via GPS data or app history)
      - Dates and times of location data
      - Patterns of movement
   - **Expected Outcome:** A map or list of locations visited, along with timestamps indicating when the user was at each location.
   - **Artifacts:**

### 4. System Logs 
   - **Objective:** Extract and analyze system logs, including device activity logs and app installs and usage history. 
   - **Procedure:** Retrieve and analyze logs from the device (e.g., app installs, device settings changes).
   - **Analysis Points:** 
      - Date and time of app installations/uninstallations
      - System logs for device behavior
      - Any errors or abnormal activity
   - **Expected Outcome:** A record of app installations, deletions, and system activity related to the time of interest.
   - **Artifacts:**
     
### 5. Other Data
   - **Objective:** Review app data to identify any relevant evidence from timestamps, browser details, etc. 
   - **Procedure:** As appropriate, extract app-specific data, such as timestamps, browser details, account information, and usage patterns.
   - **Analysis Points:** 
      - App activity logs
      - Account data 
   - **Expected Outcome:** A list of relevant data not otherwise defined that can demonstrate insecure endpoints or risks associated with using the app.
   - **Artifacts:**

### Locations of Data Storage
The following locations had the most useful data stored in it:

- **/private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/<App ID>/Library**
- **/private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/<App ID>/Meetup.app**

These folders contained app data, including caches, user data, and app metadata.
